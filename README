Directories:

lib/ contains a library for Research work using Finite Automata (RFA)
     for:
     (1) pattern matching,
     (2) ranking / language counting for formatted encryption


Build instructions:
	cd lib
	make

Testing:
	make tests

The resulting library is:
	lib/bin/rank.a

(cleaning: make cleanall)

Examples:
	lib/test/fa/src/dfa_tests.cc
          shows how DFA/NFA are constructed and how pattern matching is done
        lib/test/fa/scripts/dfa_tests.sh  testing script to invoke dfa_tests
        
	lib/test/fa_rank/src/fa_rank_tests.cc
          shows how ranking based on is done
	lib/test/fa_rank/scripts/fa_rank_tests.sh test script for fa_rank_tests
